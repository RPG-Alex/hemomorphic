Welcome to my blog. My name is Alex Blood. This is the initial blog post and marks the beginning of a blog I have been wanting to create for a long time. 

## tech-stack --list
I went out of my way to find the simplest stack I could for this blog. That means using a `static webpage`, hosted on *github pages*. 

- **[Zola](https://www.getzola.org)** — static site generator written in Rust. Perfect blend of simplicity + power.  
- **[Zola Hacker Theme](https://github.com/en9inerd/zola-hacker)** — clean, terminal-inspired look (which I'm heavily modifying).  
- **GitHub Pages** — free hosting.  
- **GitHub Actions** — runs Zola on push and publishes the site.  
- **Markdown** — still undefeated.

# goal --blog
The goal for this blog is to serve present content specific to programming and related computer science concepts. 

Unlike my [main blog](alexblood.net), this blog will be entirely focused on [Rust](rust-lang.org), Software Design & Development, Design Principles, Challenges, Experiences, etc all related to Rust and Software Development related topics. 

## whoami

I'm Alex, a software developer, father, and TRPG enthusiast with a passion for lifelong learning. I hold a software engineering degree and have spent my career diving into various technologies, from Rust to web development, database management, and have become a passionate Rustacean.

I’m working to contribute to the growing Rust ecosystem, with a special interest in open-source projects, networking, and more. 

This blog is place where I want to share my ideas, experiences, what I've learned, and what I'm planning to do next. 

### hemomorphic --meaning

The name **hemomorphic** is a combination of my last name and Rust's monomorphism.
