I'm Alex, a software developer, father, and TRPG enthusiast with a passion for lifelong learning. I hold a software engineering degree and have spent my career diving into various technologies, from Rust to web development, database management, and have become a passionate Rustacean.

I’m working to contribute to the growing Rust ecosystem, with a special interest in open-source projects, networking, and more. 

This blog is place where I want to share my ideas, experiences, what I've learned, and what I'm planning to do next. 

The name **hemomorphic** is a pun based on my last name and Rust's monomorphism.

### Tech Stack
For this blog I am using [Zola](www.getzola.org) along with the [Zola Hacker](https://github.com/en9inerd/zola-hacker) theme made by [en9inerd](https://github.com/en9inerd). Though I've modified the theme to meet my blog needs and whim. I am hosting with github pages and have configured the setup to point to the **hemomorphic** subdomain. For my non developer writings please check out my [main blog](alexblood.net).
